Note: Best viewed on a desktop browser.

CryptoTradingIS is a browser-based cryptocurrency trading simulator that lets you replay an entire year of real historical data across a selection of coins. It includes a virtual wallet, candlestick charts, and profile-based investment tracking—all powered by JavaScript and jQuery.

Features
	•	Real Historical Data: Replay one year of past cryptocurrency price data, day-by-day or in fast-forward simulation mode.
	•	Candlestick Charts: Visualize daily price movement with red and green candlestick charts using jQuery.
	•	Simulated Wallet: Buy and sell cryptocurrencies with a virtual balance. Track your portfolio’s performance over time.
	•	Multiple Local Profiles: Create different profiles within your browser to test various strategies. Each profile tracks its own wallet and progress.
	•	Multi-Speed Simulation: Step through days manually or fast-forward through the year to see how your investments play out.

Important Notes
	•	Desktop Only: The layout and experience are optimized for desktop browsers. Mobile support is limited.
	•	Session-Based: All data is stored in-memory. Once you close or refresh the browser, all profiles and progress are lost.
	•	Multi-User (Browser Only): You can create multiple user profiles within the same browser session, but no data is shared across devices or sessions.
